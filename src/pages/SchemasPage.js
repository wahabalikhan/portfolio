        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Stakeholders believed that adding 'Schemas' functionality would be a time-sensitive quick-win for users. However, there was no research to validate this assumption. The request came during a critical product roadmap planning phase where prioritization decisions would impact the next quarter.

          I conducted a comprehensive research study including:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Stakeholder interviews</span> to understand business assumptions</li>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Users didn't need the proposed quick-win feature</li>
          <li>The real pain point was in the reshape workflow, not schema visibility</li>
          <li>Data engineers wanted better ways to merge and reorganize schemas</li>
          <li>Priorities needed to shift toward workflow optimization</li>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I presented the research findings to stakeholders, clearly showing the disconnect between assumptions and user needs. By framing the insights around business outcomes and user value, I secured buy-in to pivot the roadmap toward the validated priorities.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Strategic Pivot</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Based on the research, we refined the reshape priorities and focused on merge workflows instead. This alignment between user needs and business goals led to better-scoped features that would deliver real value.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Research is an investment, not a delay. By taking time to validate assumptions, we saved significant engineering effort and built the right features. Stakeholder confidence increased because decisions were backed by data rather than intuition.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Application</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          This project established a precedent for research-first decision making in our team. It demonstrated the value of questioning assumptions and using data to guide product strategy, a practice that has influenced subsequent roadmap planning.
