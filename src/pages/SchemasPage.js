              ⚠️ The project began as a quick “feature win” by adding a search bar to the schemas panel but the real challenge was validating whether it solved genuine user pain or just an anecdotal request, requiring stakeholder buy-in to pause and reframe the problem around real user value

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Matillion’s Data Productivity Cloud (DPC) helps data teams transform and manage cloud-based data pipelines. While users could manage schemas in the legacy Matillion ETL product, the DPC version lacked parity — simple tasks like previewing data or adding schemas to pipelines required manual steps.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My goal was to validate whether users truly needed a “search” function or if there were broader workflow gaps undermining efficiency and confidence.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Research & Discovery</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I started with desk research comparing how tools like Snowflake and other IDEs managed schema interactions — revealing best practices around metadata visibility, search, and table previews.
        </p>
        <img
                    src="/images/metl.png"
                    alt="Schema presentation"
                    className="w-full rounded-lg mb-4"
                />
                <p className='mb-8 text-xs'>Matillion ETL, their legacy product, used as a reference point in the schema research. It highlights how users could search, view, and interact with schema metadata — including tables, SQL, and properties — directly within the canvas, offering a streamlined, automated workflow that informed design decisions for the new Data Productivity Cloud.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To ground findings, I conducted 5 interviews (5 internal data engineers) focused on:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>How schemas fit into their workflow</li>
          <li>What information they prioritised (metadata, tables, views)</li>
          <li>How they searched, viewed, or reused schema data</li>
          <li>What Matillion ETL did well that DPC currently lacked</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Users consistently mentioned that “searching” wasn’t the real issue — it was visibility, friction, and lack of context. Data engineers wanted to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>View schema metadata without building a pipeline</li>
          <li>Preview table data instantly (sampling)</li>
          <li>Use drag-and-drop or pre-populated components to save time</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Key findings</h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 bg-blue-50 space-y-2">
            <li className='bg-blue-50'>Search was a symptom, not the problem. Users needed holistic schema visibility and faster access to context.</li>
            <li className='bg-blue-50'>Manual effort replaced automation. What was effortless in ETL felt slow in DPC.</li>
            <li className='bg-blue-50'>Sampling mattered. Engineers wanted to see data on the fly, not through extra configuration.</li>
            <li className='bg-blue-50'>Design opportunity: Integrate schema interactions with pipeline creation for an end-to-end, intuitive experience.</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Execution</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The research exposed overlapping pain points between two initiatives — Schema Enhancements and Pipeline Creation Modals.
I proposed merging them, creating a single project addressing both data integrity and usability in one experience.</p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">This scope merge streamlined development, aligned teams, and ensured design consistency across workflows. I mapped key user flows from ETL to DPC, highlighting missing yet high-value interactions: search, metadata visibility, and schema sampling — features that directly improved productivity.

      </section>

      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Validation & Playback</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I organised a playback session with stakeholders, presenting findings through real user quotes, flow diagrams, and competitor examples. Framing the story around user impact — not features — changed the conversation.
Stakeholders immediately recognised the strategic value: “just search” had evolved into a validated, user-driven roadmap for schema management.</p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">The presentation resonated strongly. Feedback from leadership called it “clear, actionable, and aligned with user workflows.” The team agreed to prioritise merging both initiatives for the next release phase.
