        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Matillion is a cloud-native data transformation platform that enables businesses to extract, load, and transform data in modern cloud data warehouses. As a Product Designer on the Platform Team, I worked on improving the Git integration experience within our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) product.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Problem Statement</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Users struggled to understand what changes were being made when performing Git operations. The lack of visibility created uncertainty and reduced confidence in the platform, particularly for teams collaborating on complex data transformation projects.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Users couldn't see what changed before committing</li>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I designed and shipped a comprehensive Git Diff feature that showed users exactly what changed in their pipelines and transformations. The solution included visual indicators, side-by-side comparisons, and contextual information about modifications. Additionally, I implemented several quality-of-life improvements to streamline the entire Git workflow.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Collaboration</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I worked closely with engineering to ensure technical feasibility while maintaining design quality. Regular check-ins with the product team helped prioritize features, and user testing sessions validated our approach before full rollout.
