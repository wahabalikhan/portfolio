                    Matillion is a cloud-native data transformation platform that enables businesses to extract, load, and transform data in modern cloud data warehouses. As a Product Designer on the DataOps team, I worked on improving the Git integration experience within our product, the Data Productivity Cloud.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I led the design of Git Diff, a new visibility feature within Matillion‚Äôs data transformation platform that gave data engineers confidence when managing version control. Working within the Platform team, I shaped the end-to-end experience ‚Äî from discovery and user research through to design, testing, and metric tracking. Git Diff enabled users to see exactly what changed before committing, reducing uncertainty and streamlining collaboration. The rollout drove a 34% increase in commits, a 15% reduction in Git resets, and a broader 25% uplift in engagement across Git workflows.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We explored multiple ways to make Git changes more transparent without disrupting existing workflows. Two main directions emerged:
Inline visibility, where users could see changes directly within their workspace, and side-by-side comparison, mirroring the familiarity of established Git tools. The latter was prioritised for its clarity and alignment with user expectations uncovered in research.</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">From early flows to high-fidelity prototypes, I focused on making diffs scannable and trustworthy ‚Äî introducing visual indicators, contextual metadata, and lightweight animations to help users understand what changed and why. Alongside the core feature, I identified and designed several quality-of-life improvements across the Git experience, reducing friction and aligning interactions with broader platform patterns.
