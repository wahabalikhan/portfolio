          Matillion is a cloud-native data transformation platform that enables businesses to extract, load, and transform data in modern cloud data warehouses. As a Product Designer on the Platform Team, I worked on improving the Git integration experience within our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) product.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I designed and shipped a comprehensive Git Diff feature that showed users exactly what changed in their pipelines and transformations. The solution included visual indicators, side-by-side comparisons, and contextual information about modifications. Additionally, I implemented several quality-of-life improvements to streamline the entire Git workflow.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-900">Collaboration</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I worked closely with engineering to ensure technical feasibility while maintaining design quality. Regular check-ins with the product team helped prioritize features, and user testing sessions validated our approach before full rollout.
