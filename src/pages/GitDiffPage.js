                    Matillion is a cloud-native data transformation platform that enables businesses to extract, load, and transform data in modern cloud data warehouses. As a Product Designer on the DataOps team, I worked on improving the Git integration experience within our product, the Data Productivity Cloud.

                    I led the design of Git Diff, a new visibility feature within Matillion‚Äôs Data Producutivity Cloud that gave data engineers confidence when managing version control. Working within the DataOps team, I shaped the end-to-end experience from discovery and user research through to design, testing, and metric tracking. Git Diff enabled users to see exactly what changed before committing, reducing uncertainty and streamlining collaboration.

I defined the research plan, facilitated ideation workshops, and set up ongoing metrics to track adoption and confidence post-launch.</p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I ran competitive analysis on leading IDEs, user interviews on workflow pain points, and a cross-functional workshop to co-create solutions. This revealed that:

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We explored two concepts: inline visibility and side-by-side comparison.

                    </ul>
                    Testing showed users preferred the latter for clarity and familiarity, so I refined the design into an interactive diff view with colour-coded indicators and contextual filters. The result was a transparent, scannable experience that built user confidence.</p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">From early flows to high-fidelity prototypes, I focused on making diffs scannable and trustworthy by introducing visual indicators to help users understand what changed and why.

                    I partnered with engineering to design and deliver Git Diff as a scalable, technically feasible feature. Through iterative builds and design QA, we balanced performance with clarity, ensuring the final implementation matched the intended UX. Regular check-ins with Product helped prioritise and sequence improvements for rollout.
