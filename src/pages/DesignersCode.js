        Should designers learn how to code?

          This question pops up every few months — sometimes as a debate, sometimes as a humble-brag. The truth? There’s no single answer. But after a few years designing with one hand on Figma and the other occasionally buried in VS Code, I’ve landed on this: designers don’t need to code — but learning to think in code changes everything.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When I first started, I treated design and development as two separate worlds: the dreamers and the builders. But the more I worked on complex systems, the more that line blurred. I realised that understanding how components behave, how states change, and how data flows doesn’t make me less of a designer — it makes me a better one.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Knowing how to code isn’t about writing production-ready apps. It’s about empathy.
          It’s about understanding why your “simple animation” request might take half a sprint, or why a design system token actually matters. It’s about communicating with engineers in their language, so collaboration feels less like a handoff and more like a conversation.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          And here’s the secret benefit: once you start coding, you stop designing in screenshots. You start designing in flow — thinking about interactions, constraints, performance, and behaviour. That awareness shapes cleaner, more realistic designs that ship faster and break less.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          So no, you don’t need to be a front-end developer. But you should get comfortable opening a text editor, tweaking some CSS, or prototyping logic in a sandbox. Even a tiny bit of code literacy changes how you see your craft.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For me, it’s not about being a “unicorn.” It’s about curiosity.
          And that curiosity — to understand how things actually work — is one of the most powerful design tools you can have.
