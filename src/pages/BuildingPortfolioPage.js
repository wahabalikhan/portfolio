        Building my portfolio (accidentally rebuilt Figma)

          I wanted a personal website that felt, well... personal. Not just another portfolio with a grid of thumbnails and a bit of copy. Something that showed my work, sure, but also gave a sense of who I am and how I think about design.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          So I started building. And then something funny happened. As I was designing the case study layout, I realized I needed a way to organize components, create reusable patterns, and maintain consistency across pages. Sound familiar?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Before I knew it, I had accidentally built a mini design system. Not as sophisticated as Figma, obviously, but the parallels were there. I had created components, variants, auto-layout patterns, and even a crude version of constraints.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          It made me appreciate just how much thought goes into the tools we use every day. Building even a simple portfolio forces you to confront all the same challenges: consistency, scalability, flexibility, and maintenance.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The process also reminded me why design systems matter. Without those foundations, every page becomes a new design challenge. With them, you can focus on content and narrative rather than reinventing the wheel.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          So while I may not have built the next Figma, I did build something that works for me. And more importantly, I gained a deeper appreciation for the tools and systems that make our work possible.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Sometimes the best way to understand something is to try building it yourself. Even if what you end up with is just a humble portfolio website.
