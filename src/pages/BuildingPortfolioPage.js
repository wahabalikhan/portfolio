          Designing my own portfolio has always felt like an identity crisis in code form. You want it to look polished enough to reflect your craft — but still feel alive, personal, and a little bit you. So instead of treating it like a static showcase, I decided to vibe-code it — part design, part development, and a lot of creative improvisation.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This version of my site lives somewhere between Figma and production. I use VS Code Copilot and Claude to speed up development and problem-solve as I go, with GitHub as my version control safety net (and sometimes my memory). The setup feels less like a toolchain and more like a conversation between creative and technical instincts.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Under the hood, it’s built with Tailwind CSS — lightweight, fast, and expressive enough to let me design directly in the browser. I’m pulling live repo data from GitHub’s API using personal tokens, so case studies and projects update dynamically as I commit new work. It’s a small touch, but it makes the portfolio feel less like a frozen snapshot and more like an evolving log of what I’m actually building.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Every component, every line of code is a reminder that design and engineering are never separate. My own coding knowledge helps bridge the gap — turning visual ideas into living, interactive pieces without waiting on a full build pipeline. It’s hands-on, sometimes messy, but deeply satisfying.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Building this site wasn’t just about having a nice place to host projects. It was about owning the process end-to-end — from concept to commit. Every gradient, hover, and animation is a design decision expressed through code. That’s what vibe-coding means to me: creating things that feel designed and built in the same heartbeat.
